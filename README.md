# Qt yaml-cpp Adapter

A Qt adapter for [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp).

## iborcocpputils

This library uses [iborcocpputils](git@github.com:borco/iborcocpputils.git).

To use it, add *iborcocpputils* as a submodule to your top project and add the location as a subdirectory. *iborcocpputils* is not added a submodule to this project because it is common to other utility libs that I use.
